Looking for a **Vietnam plywood manufacturer** that ships on time, every time — without middleman markup? You are in the right place.

**Key Takeaways:** HCPLY is a **Vietnam plywood manufacturer** operating 3 production lines in Phu Tho Province. We export 200+ containers monthly to India, UAE, Korea, Germany, and 26 more countries — with [FSC](https://fsc.org), [CARB P2](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/composite-wood-products-program), CE, and ISO 9001 certifications.

## What Vietnam Plywood Manufacturer HCPLY Produces

As a dedicated Vietnam plywood manufacturer since 2018, we produce 13 product lines covering construction formwork, furniture production, interior decoration, industrial packaging, and raw veneer supply. In our experience shipping to [30+ countries](/about-vietnam-plywood-factory/), buyers consistently value three things: competitive FOB pricing, reliable certification documentation, and fast container turnaround.

**Plywood export**: the process of manufacturing and shipping engineered wood panels internationally under trade compliance standards.

**FOB pricing**: Free On Board — the buyer pays shipping from port, while the manufacturer covers all costs to the vessel. Every panel ships from our [Ha Hoa factory](/about-vietnam-plywood-factory/) with complete export paperwork — CO, FSC certificate, phytosanitary, fumigation, and commercial invoice.

## Why Choose This Vietnam Plywood Manufacturer

In my 6+ years managing international sales at HCPLY, I have found that importers consistently face three problems: **delayed shipments**, **quality inconsistency between batches**, and **opaque pricing from trading companies**. That is exactly why we built a different model.

### Factory-Direct Advantage

According to [Vietnam Customs, 2025](https://customs.gov.vn), Vietnam exported over 4 million CBM of plywood products last year — a 12% increase from 2023. Per [FAO, 2024](https://www.fao.org/forestry/statistics), Vietnam ranks among the top 5 plywood exporters globally. However, many buyers still order through intermediaries, adding 15-25% markup. As a direct Vietnam plywood manufacturer, we eliminate middleman costs entirely — buyers deal with our production team at the factory floor in Ha Hoa, Phu Tho.

Here is a real-world example: in Q3 2025, a UAE furniture importer switched from a Malaysian trading company to HCPLY direct. Our results showed an 18% cost reduction on bintangor panels, 3-day faster lead time, and zero quality rejections across 12 containers.
