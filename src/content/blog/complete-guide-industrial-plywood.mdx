## Understanding Plywood Grades

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
Always request grade certification from suppliers before placing bulk orders. This ensures consistent quality across your project.
</Callout>

Plywood grading varies by region but generally follows the A-D scale, where A represents the highest quality with minimal defects and D allows for more imperfections. Understanding these grades is crucial for selecting the right material for your specific application.
